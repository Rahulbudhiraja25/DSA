# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice Repository! This repository is a commitment to consistently solve DSA questions, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced levels, step by step.

## ðŸŸ¢ Objective
- Solve at least **1 question daily** (and aim for 2 whenever possible).
- Strengthen problem-solving skills and master DSA concepts for technical interviews.

## ðŸ“œ Roadmap
1. Basics of Java & Problem-Solving
2. Arrays & Strings
3. Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues
4. Recursion & Backtracking
5. Trees & Graphs
6. Hashing & Heaps
7. Dynamic Programming
8. System Design & Object-Oriented Design
9. Mock Interviews & Revision

## ðŸŸ¢ Structure
Each folder contains solutions organized by topic:
- Java Basics
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Trees & Graphs
- Hashing & Heaps
- Dynamic Programming
- System Design

## ðŸš€ Commitment
This repo is a testament to my dedication to mastering DSA. I will document my progress, note down approaches, and analyze complexity for each solution.

Let's ace DSA and get ready for the Big 4 interviews!
